# `formiclimate`

A handmade, very janky climate control system for my ants, controlled by an _Arduino Micro_

The ultimate goal of this project is to be something anyone can build on a budget, but it's got a
lot of evolution and documentation to go before that happens

## Build Instructions

1. Install prerequisites as described in the [`avr-hal` README] (`avr-gcc`, `avr-libc`, `avrdude`, [`ravedude`]).

2. Run `cargo build` to build the firmware.

3. Run `cargo run` to flash the firmware to a connected board.  If `ravedude`
   fails to detect your board, check its documentation at
   <https://crates.io/crates/ravedude>.

4. `ravedude` will open a console session after flashing where you can interact
   with the UART console of your board.
